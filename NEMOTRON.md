# Nemotron 3 Super Project Notes

This branch is the integration branch for a narrow local compression and
inference path targeting
`nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4`.

Feature work branches from `nemotron-main` under `feature/nemotron-*`, is tested
there, and merges back only after correctness, numerical integrity, storage,
and relevant performance checks pass.

DS4 and Ornith remain independent references. Useful infrastructure may be
copied into Nemotron-specific files and adapted, but this target must not depend
on either model's implementation.

## Why This Target

Nemotron 3 Super is substantially more tractable than Ornith as a first
consumer-hardware compression target:

- 120B total parameters and about 12B active parameters per token
- hybrid NemotronH architecture with Mamba2, LatentMoE, and full attention
- official QAT mixed-precision NVFP4 checkpoint
- official NVFP4 quality reported close to the BF16 model on several coding and
  reasoning evaluations
- routed experts account for most checkpoint storage, giving structural pruning
  meaningful leverage

The first objective is a high-quality artifact in the 54-60 GiB range that can
run with useful context and runtime headroom on a 64 GB Mac. A 32 GB RTX 5090
target will initially require host-memory offload; fitting the complete model in
32 GB is not a quality-safe first milestone.

## Official Checkpoint Baseline

Current indexed sizes from the official repositories:

| Source | Indexed bytes | GiB | Shards | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| NVFP4 | 80,297,329,824 | 74.78 | 17 | Primary prune-only baseline |
| FP8 | 128,334,890,312 | 119.52 | 26 | Higher-precision diagnostics |
| BF16 | 247,222,108,160 | 230.24 | 50 | Reference and new quantization research |

These are tensor payload sizes, not peak download-space requirements. Temporary
files, filesystem allocation, Hugging Face metadata, and accidental duplicate
caches must be considered before fetching weights.

The index also contains 1,040 `mtp.*` tensors. The config declares one
next-token prediction layer with MTP pattern `*E`. The metadata catalog keeps
these separate from backbone experts. We may eventually omit MTP from a
non-speculative runtime artifact, but only after verifying the official forward
path and measuring its exact byte contribution; pruning code must not mistake
MTP experts for backbone experts.

The primary model directory is:

```text
/Users/nir/dev/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4
```

The initial metadata snapshot is pinned to Hugging Face revision
`4f0cf9daaeb7a4d5e23f80a00e7ed15f0e03caf6` and stored under `metadata/` in
that directory. `source-manifest.json` records the source identity and SHA-256
hashes of the downloaded metadata files.

No weight download starts without explicit approval. Small metadata may be
stored there to pin architecture, shard maps, revisions, and hashes.

### Verified Local Source

The complete official NVFP4 snapshot was downloaded on 2026-07-10 to:

```text
/Users/nir/dev/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4/source-nvfp4
```

It is pinned to revision `4f0cf9daaeb7a4d5e23f80a00e7ed15f0e03caf6`.
Hugging Face CLI `1.21.0` verified all 36 repository files with both missing
and extra files treated as failures. The source contains 17 safetensors shards,
80,317,948,856 bytes of safetensors files including headers, and
80,365,683,780 bytes across all repository files. Its config and index match
the separately hashed metadata snapshot byte-for-byte.

The 152 KiB `.cache/huggingface` local-dir metadata was removed after the
strict verification because the verifier otherwise reports its own metadata as
extra files. The source tree is now immutable input. Future jobs must write to
separate directories and must not modify or delete source shards.

The durable local verification record is:

```text
/Users/nir/dev/models/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4/source-nvfp4-state.json
```

## Compression Strategy

NVIDIA's NVFP4 checkpoint is already a mixed-precision, QAT-produced artifact.
The initial path therefore avoids dequantizing and requantizing it.

### Phase 1: Exact Structural Pruning

1. Pin and catalog the official NVFP4 checkpoint revision.
2. Decode enough ModelOpt metadata to validate every quantized tensor and scale.
3. Collect activation-aware routing and expert-output statistics from the
   unmodified checkpoint.
4. Generate conservative 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, and 35% expert-pruning plans.
5. Materialize candidates by slicing routed-expert tensors, router rows, and
   router correction bias together.
6. Prove that every retained payload and scale is byte-identical to the source.
7. Compare logits and downstream coding quality against the official NVFP4
   baseline.

For LatentMoE, routing frequency alone is insufficient. The observer should at
minimum retain route counts, routing weights, activation maxima, and a REAP-like
route-weighted expert-output norm measured in the latent expert space before the
output projection. The exact equation must be verified against NVIDIA's model
implementation before it becomes a quality gate.

### Size Leverage

The official NVFP4 index attributes approximately 59.05 GiB to routed experts
and 15.74 GiB to fixed tensors. Idealized uniform expert pruning therefore gives
the following payload estimates:

| Routed experts removed | Estimated payload |
| ---: | ---: |
| 0% | 74.78 GiB |
| 10% | 68.88 GiB |
| 20% | 62.97 GiB |
| 25% | 60.02 GiB |
| 30% | 57.07 GiB |
| 35% | 54.11 GiB |
| 40% | 51.16 GiB |

These estimates do not establish acceptable quality. The 30-35% range is the
interesting 64 GB operating region, but evaluation must determine whether it is
safe.

### Phase 2: Optional Quantization Research

Only after a prune-only quality point is established should another format be
considered. NVFP4-to-low-bit conversion is double quantization and is not the
preferred source for format research. A serious new quantization recipe should
start from BF16, retain sensitive Mamba state, routing, normalization, latent
projection, embedding, and output tensors at measured precision, and use
activation-aware per-tensor or per-expert evidence.

## Infrastructure Plan

The reusable ideas from Ornith are operational rather than architectural:

- one shard processing while one successor downloads
- bounded disk use with explicit cache placement
- atomic output validation before raw deletion
- durable state transitions and exact resumption
- immutable source and policy identity
- human-readable stdout plus durable logs
- metadata-only size planning
- calibration coverage and quality reports

They will be copied and rewritten under `nemotron_*` names. Ornith `.ornq`,
Qwen3.5 layouts, quantization policies, REAP observations, and runtime kernels
are not valid inputs for Nemotron.

## Initial Milestones

1. Metadata-only model catalog and architecture assertions.
2. ModelOpt NVFP4 tensor/scale parser with small synthetic fixtures.
3. Resumable download and exact-copy validation smoke on one approved shard.
4. Exact structural-pruning materializer and metadata remapping tests.
5. Official NVFP4 baseline runner and LatentMoE observer.
6. Conservative prune-only candidate ladder and quality evaluation.
7. Model-specific Metal runtime, followed by CUDA/offload work where useful.

Runtime optimization starts only after a candidate can be loaded and compared
against a trusted implementation. The final hot path should minimize CPU/GPU
boundaries, retain recurrent state on the device, and measure full-token decode
rather than isolated matrix kernels.

## Current Tools

Run the current repository and pinned-metadata checks:

```sh
./nemotron/check.sh
```

`nemotron/tools/nemotron_metadata.py` verifies the immutable metadata hashes,
NemotronH architecture, hybrid layer pattern, shard sequence, ModelOpt mixed
precision, complete eight-object NVFP4 expert groups, and matching router
tensors. It writes the derived catalog atomically to the external metadata
directory. Set `NEMOTRON_MODEL_DIR` when using a different local storage root.

## Acceptance Gates

A candidate is not promoted based on size or a few prompts. It must pass:

- strict metadata, tensor shape, dtype, and quantization validation
- exact retained-payload validation for prune-only artifacts
- deterministic reference logits at multiple prompt and context lengths
- coding, reasoning, instruction-following, and long-context evaluations
- explicit quant-only, prune-only, and combined comparisons
- memory accounting that includes weights, recurrent/KV state, scratch, runtime,
  and operating-system headroom
- repeatable prefill and decode performance measurements on target hardware

Every failed candidate remains clearly labeled diagnostic and must not become a
source for later calibration or production compression.
